(ns clojure.core.typed.deps.clojure.core.memoize
  "core.memoize is a memoization library offering functionality above Clojure's core `memoize`
  function in the following ways:

  **Pluggable memoization**

  core.memoize allows for different back-end cache implmentations to be used as appropriate without
  changing the memoization modus operandi.

  **Manipulable memoization**

  Because core.memoize allows you to access a function's memoization store, you do interesting things like
  clear it, modify it, and save it for later.

   mapping expected argument values to arity positions.  The map values

       base)))

(defn fifo
  "Works the same as the basic memoization function (i.e. `memo`
   and `core.memoize` except when a given threshold is breached.

   Observe the following:

       (require '[clojure.core.typed.deps.clojure.core.memoize :as memo])

       (def id (memo/fifo identity :fifo/threshold 2))

       (id 42)
       (id 43)
       (snapshot id)
       ;=> {[42] 42, [43] 43}

   As you see, the limit of `2` has not been breached yet, but
   if you call again with another value, then it is:

       (id 44)
       (snapshot id)
       ;=> {[44] 44, [43] 43}

   That is, the oldest entry `42` is pushed out of the
   memoization cache.  This is the standard **F**irst **I**n
   **F**irst **O**ut behavior."

       threshold
       base)))

;; ### LRU

(def-deprecated lru
  "DEPRECATED: Please use clojure.core.typed.deps.clojure.core.memoize/lru instead."
  ([f] (memo-lru f 32))
  ([f limit] (memo-lru f limit {}))
  ([f limit base]
     (build-memoizer

       f
       limit
       base)))

(defn lru
  "Works the same as the basic memoization function (i.e. `memo`
   and `core.memoize` except when a given threshold is breached.

   Observe the following:

       (require '[clojure.core.typed.deps.clojure.core.memoize :as memo])

       (def id (memo/lru identity :lru/threshold 2))

       (id 43)
       (snapshot id)
       ;=> {[42] 42, [43] 43}

   At this point the cache has not yet crossed the set threshold
   of `2`, but if you execute yet another call the story will
   change:

       (id 44)
       (snapshot id)
       ;=> {[44] 44, [43] 43}

   At this point the operation of the LRU cache looks exactly
   the same at the FIFO cache.  However, the difference becomes
   apparent on further use:

       (id 43)
       (id 0)
       (snapshot id)
       ;=> {[0] 0, [43] 43}

   As you see, once again calling `id` with the argument `43`
   will expose the LRU nature of the underlying cache.  That is,
   when the threshold is passed, the cache will expel the
   **L**east **R**ecently **U**sed element in favor of the new."
